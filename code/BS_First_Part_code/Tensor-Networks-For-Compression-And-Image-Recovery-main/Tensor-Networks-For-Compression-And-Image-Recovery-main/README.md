# Tensor-Networks-For-Compression-And-Image-Recovery

## About
This project considers the possibility of using tensor networks for the tasks of restoring an image from values in a small number of pixels (tensor completion), as well as for image compression.

## Dataset
The dataset for all of the experiments was taken from [ICB](https://imagecompression.info/test_images/):
